A WordPress Framework To Empower Your Development

== Description ==

TypeRocket is a WordPress framework carefully crafted to empower your development workflow.

- Enjoy MVC in WordPress
- Control Your Custom Fields

*Create custom post types* in a snap using a friendly OOP API. With 20 lines of code your post types can have custom fields, meta boxes, and more.

*Ditch plugin bloat* by leveraging power TypeRocket APIs instead of installing just one more plugin.

*Enjoy MVC* in WordPress for a modern development experience. With just a routes, models, views, and controller at your finger tips you can create more advanced applications.

*Control your custom fields* and add them anywhere you want in WordPress. Front-end or Backend. Plus, you can create own custom fields when you need too.
